# Network_Manipulation_Python
Create,explore and manipulate networks, given a weight matrix, via a simple Python program

Given any weight matrix in a csv file, this Python program creates the network assigned to this matrix, calculates all fundamental network measures (conectivity, complexity, 14 centralities, transativity etc) and creates plots and network graphs based on these measures.
